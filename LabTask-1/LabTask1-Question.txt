1. Write a C# program to count the number of characters from a name. 
2. Define a loop starting from 1 to 15. Then in each iteration your program will check whether it is an odd number or even number. So final output will be 15 lines showing either even or odd number.   
3. Prime number checking. Declare an integer variable such as int value = 10 or any other numeric value. Now define the program to check whether it is a prime number or not. Remember the output will in one line.
